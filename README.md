## Bujo the digital Bullet Journal
https://github.com/nayaba/digital-bujo-client

Buju is a simple app that offers a digital alternative to the popular note-taking/organization method known as bullet journaling (or 'Bujo' for short).  With the Bujo app anyone can start a new journal and begin creating entries right away.  Each entry gets tagged with a symbol based on the tradtional bullet journal symbol key:

- '-' a note
- '*' a task
- '+' an event
- '>' a task to do later (a migrated task)

Use these symbols to keep track of your to-do list, along with any notes or bursts of inspiration that come your way throughout the day.  Entries are archived in chronological order to make them easy to find, update, or delete if desired.
